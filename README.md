# Email Noise Filter 🤖🧹

An open-source AI automation agent that scans your inbox and **automatically labels useless emails** — helping you focus only on what truly matters.  

Built using **n8n** and **GPT-4o**, this agent runs continuously to clean up promotional clutter, sales spam, and redundant confirmations — with **zero false positives on genuine, human-written messages**.

---

## 🔧 What It Does

- 📥 **Monitors your Gmail inbox** for every new incoming email  
- 🧠 **Uses GPT-4o** to analyze the subject and body of each message  
- 🏷️ **Applies a "Noise" label** to emails classified as useless (see categories below)  
- ⛔ **Avoids false positives** using a strict exclusion rule for authentic messages  
- 🔁 **Runs passively in the background** with near real-time execution

---

## 🧠 Classification Logic

The agent marks an email as **"useless"** if it fits one of the following categories:

1. **Meeting Acceptance**  
   - Confirmations like “See you at 3pm” or “Meeting confirmed.”  
   - ✅ *Excludes invites or rescheduling (these are kept).*

2. **Sales**  
   - Cold outreach, demo requests, pricing proposals, or upsells.

3. **Marketing**  
   - Product updates, newsletters, campaigns, feature releases, and announcements.

4. **Advertisement**  
   - Sponsored content, third-party ads, or affiliate offers.

5. **Promotion**  
   - Discounts, deals, limited-time offers, coupons, or sales campaigns.

> **🚫 Important Exclusion Rule:**  
> Do NOT classify a message as “useless” if it's a genuine, human-written email — like job-related inquiries, support requests, personal introductions, or collaborative messages. These stay untouched.

## 🧩 Workflow Architecture

**Gmail (new message)** → **n8n** → **Extract subject + content** → **GPT-4o** → **Label as "Noise" or ignore** → **Gmail**

Each email is parsed and passed through GPT-4o, where it’s classified based on the logic above. If marked “useless,” it gets tagged in Gmail for easy filtering or archiving.

## 📦 Installation & Usage

### 1. Requirements

- Running **n8n** instance (local or cloud-hosted)
- API credentials for:
  - OpenAI (GPT-4o access)
  - Google Cloud (OAuth for Gmail API)

### 2. Import Workflow

1. Download the `agent-workflow.json` file from this repo  
2. Log into your n8n dashboard  
3. Click the **Import** icon on the top bar  
4. Upload the JSON to load the pre-built workflow

### 3. Customize

- Add your **OpenAI API key** and **Gmail OAuth credentials**  
- Modify Gmail label names (e.g., `Noise`, `Filtered`)  
- Tweak the GPT-4o classification prompt if needed  
- (Optional) Add logic to archive or auto-delete certain "Noise" labels

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Uses OAuth 2.0 for Gmail API access  
- No email content is stored or logged by default  
- Only GPT-4o sees the email content for classification  
- False positives are rare due to strict filtering logic and exclusions
